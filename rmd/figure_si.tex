FCL are expressed as a function of ecosystem size (river length, \(L\))
and complexity (branching rate, \(\lambda_b\)), with rows and columns
reflecting different disturbance and resource supply regimes. Each cell
represents the average FCL of 20 food webs. White dashed lines indicate
specific scenarios, explored in Figure \ref{fig:sim-main}B and C.
Additional parameter values are provided in Table 1.}
